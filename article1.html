            <p>Today is World Down’s Syndrome Day, an international celebration of the condition, aiming also at increasing awareness and fundraising for supporting children and young adults with Down’s syndrome as well as their families. Today I’ll be sharing some thoughts on disability and ideas of success, drawing on personal experiences of my brother, who has Down’s syndrome.</p>
            
            <p>The day is selected to be the 21st day of the third month March to reflect chromosome 21’s trisomy, or triplication that is the genetic cause of the condition. Occurring naturally,1 in 1000 babies in the UK are born with the condition. In general, the condition causes varying degrees of physical and intellectual disabilities. My brother, Tahsin, was born in 2012 with Down’s syndrome and was assessed to be on the autism spectrum in late in 2020. He’s charming, a brilliant drummer, always curious and caring towards others. When he was born, my parents were terrified. They had little to no knowledge of the condition, and few relatives or friends to ask for support after immigrating here, and none with experience with Down’s. My brother spent a week in a neonatal intensive care unit and we waited anxiously for reports on his heart condition. He eventually stabilised, his doctors grew confident with his organ function, and my mother could hold her newborn son for the first time.</p>

            <p>I’d like to share some of the challenges he faces daily. He has low muscle tone, affecting his ability to communicate, coordinate his limbs and utilise his fine motor skills effectively. He has glue ear, a fluctuating hearing impairment that is lessened by his hearing aids. He’s registered as partially blind and has been diagnosed with nystagmus, an involuntary, repetitive jitter of the eyes. His memory isn’t always 100% and it takes him a little longer to learn some things. He also struggles to project and think about events in the future.</p>

            <p>Intellectual and physical disabilities like the ones Tahsin has, are not insurmountable and it’s important to keep things in perspective. Our role as peers of those with Down’s is not to cure or try to fix them; but instead accept their differences and provide the social and emotional tools, they need to work through the challenges set by the polarising and unforgiving world around us. Realising this takes time to set in. And the reason it takes time for parents, family, friends of those with Down’s is that they are scared and terrified of how the world will treat their loved ones.</p>
            
            <p>For Tahsin, his sensory inputs are chaotic. If he were sat in the front row now, he’d be hearing the traffic outside as loud as my voice, not to mention the echoes of the speakers. He would be trying his hardest to focus on my face, anxious that he can’t quite see me behind the lectern, anxious that he can’t quite tell how I’m feeling. He’d translate this anxiety and frustration into perhaps making his own noise to organise the sounds in his head, or, because he knows this is an assembly and he should be quiet, he’d pick at the skin on his fingers to distract himself. He would make repetitive movements of his limbs, to get a sense of regularity, something predictable. In other scenarios, where he’s frightened and distressed, he finds it difficult to communicate: he can’t find the peace to control his voice. Thinking about these challenges, how can one not shout and scream?</p>
            
            <p>I remember watching members of the public stare at my brother misbehaving in a supermarket and my mother desperately attempting to calm him down. And as I grew and I spent more and more time with him independently, I began to feel those stares and that judgement myself. My parents outside of the house lived in that shame. That they could not parent their son, and their son’s negative behaviour was undeniable proof. People around them suggested they needed to be harsher, stricter, but that was the last thing he needed. There was little attempt from them to try and understand.</p>

            <p>When he runs up to strangers in the supermarket and gets super close and says hello, that’s him wanting to understand how that person is feeling, understand why they’re standing alone, looking down at the canned tomatoes with an expressionless face. We can put it together that they’re simply shopping and probably doing okay, but for Tahsin he wants to make sure that they are happy, that they are smiling. When he’s in a super long corridor at the hospital, he knows that if he yells at the top of his voice, it’ll create a phenomenal echo and that’ll be all he can hear for a couple of seconds. In that moment of disruptive behaviour, is his peace, it’s his way of finding normal, something regular. When he meets new children his age, he’ll spend ages looking at their face, trying his hardest to calm the incessant shaking and focus on their facial features, their voice, so when Tahsin sees them again he can say hello and ask them how they are. In conversation, Tahsin will go ‘Why’s this’, ‘Why’s that’ that can get quite repetitive. For him, he’s found this magic word that he can attach to anything and continue conversation. He loves talking to people but finds it hard to organise the ideas in his head. These are just a few examples of how Tahsin isn’t always naturally compliant. But when his behaviour is met with eye rolls and shaking heads, that judgement? It’s only going to make Tahsin, and my parents feel more ashamed, rejected, unworthy. And what’s worse is that he’s sometimes still too young to be aware of this all. He’s only begun communicating his experiences as he builds his conversational skills. When Tahsin struggles, he needs love and kindness to help him through his challenges, not strict harsh treatment.</p>

            <p>Before taking my brother anywhere my parents would worry about how hosts would react, if they would be supportive, if they would be caring and accepting of Tahsin’s differences. People saw him as a failure. People still do. People see dependency, see an inability to things that they can do easily and feel sorry and imagine that it must be miserable all the time for the disabled. They call his condition a curse and shut down his prospects because they don’t align with their definition of success. I’ve been guilty of something similar. When I was younger, I made a Google search. Into a search bar I typed ‘How can I fix my brother’, ‘How can I cure him of his Down’s’ and hit enter. In that moment, I had failed him. I had given up on him. I had failed to believe that he could be happy, that he could have success in his life. I regret that Google search. I was so wrong. We have never stepped in his shoes. We have never experienced what he has experienced and never can from a non-disabled perspective. We don’t have a right to project our non-disabled ideas of success.</p>
            
            <p>The idea of success is often one defined by metrics. Your marks in exams, performances on the sports field or how major your part in the school play is. We use these in everyday life to judge and form opinions. And not only in school life. As we leave and go on to be employees and employers, hold shares in companies, where statistics like income, net worth, and numbers define and value our livelihoods, they’ll provide more markers of success. And justifiably so: they are easy to measure, easy to compare, easy to put someone down not only without much argument but also without much appreciation of personal context, hardships, and journey. Your effects on the people are hard to measure and describing them is inherently subjective. But the fact we can’t quantify them doesn’t make them irrelevant. It doesn’t invalidate them in our search to define success. I think at a highly selective school, where academic success, numbers are so much at the forefront of decision making that we can grow ignorant of context. We can begin to dangerously think of success as superiority.</p>

            <p>For Tahsin, his context is and will always be in part his disability. He may not grow and become a leading academic, a world-class musician, win a Nobel Prize or become an influential politician: he won’t be ‘successful’ in society’s definition of the word. But when it comes to making his family, his close friends, and the people around him smile, brightening all our lives with his perseverance, his success is inestimable. Having Tahsin as a brother is the single greatest blessing I have ever and will ever have. He’s taught me so much and has made me the person I am today. After 3 and a half years of battling with the council for a place at a school for special needs children, culminating in a court case, they settled a fortnight ago and offered him a place for September. We hope that he’ll feel comfortable and more at home there.</p>

            <p>I’ll end with this. Remember that success is not superiority. Success is something to share. Make your success hard to measure.</p>

            <p>Happy World Down’s Syndrome Day.</p>
